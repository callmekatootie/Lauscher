This UI is generated by create-react-app package.

## Dependencies

- nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/ (v8+)

## Configuration
As application uses Topcoder authorization we have to run it on the one of allowed domains. For development purposes we can use `local.topcoder-dev.com:3000`. So before run we have to add into `hosts` file the line `127.0.0.1 local.topcoder-dev.com`. Be aware, that we also have to run on the port `3000` to be able to authorize when run locally.

Configuration is at `src/config/config.js`.
